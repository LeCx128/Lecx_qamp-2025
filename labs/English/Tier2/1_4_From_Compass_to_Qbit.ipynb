    "> “Imagine your three-dimensional compass, suspended above the board, can point not only north or south, but in any direction in space.  \n",
    "> But something changes: we are no longer talking just about physical angles, but about **probabilities** of being in one orientation or another.  \n",
    "> Could your compass be partially north and partially south at the same time?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Questions:**\n",
    "- What would it mean for a compass to point “halfway” between two opposite directions?  \n",
    "- Can we describe that position as a combination of two extreme states?  \n",
    "- How could we represent this mixture numerically?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief Activity:**\n",
    "- Ask students to build a Bloch hemisphere on a surface.  \n",
    "- Then, draw the **Z+** (north) and **Z−** (south) axes.  \n",
    "- Use a paper strip to represent the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Objective**  \n",
    "- Understand the nature of quantum states.  \n",
    "- Design a physical, mathematical, and computational model of a state vector.  \n",

    "## 2. Explore — Hands-On Activity: Paper Strip and Phase Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials:**  \n",
    "Paper strip (10–15 cm), tape, flashlight or lamp, whiteboard or wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure:**  \n",
    "1. Attach the strip vertically to the wall or board.  \n",
    "2. Create a Cartesian plane using the base of the strip as the center.  \n",
    "3. Draw a circle using the length of the paper strip as the diameter.  \n",
    "4. Illuminate it perpendicularly with the flashlight: observe the shadow.  \n",
    "5. Rotate the strip a few degrees in the air → the shadow changes position.  \n",
    "6. Move the flashlight (without rotating the strip) → the shadow changes even though the physical orientation remains the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "- Design a model corresponding to the different configurations of the magnetic field.  \n",
    "- Introduce the idea of a **non-directly visible simultaneity** (superposition).  \n",
    "- Connect that orientation with the **mathematical description of the state**.\n",

    "In the vertical plane of the board, identify two extreme states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the needle points fully toward **north** (up along the Z-axis):  \n",
    "  → we call it state **∣0⟩**.  \n",
    "- When it points fully toward **south** (down along the Z-axis):  \n",
    "  → it will be state **∣1⟩**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two states form our **computational basis**, i.e., the fundamental reference points.\n",

    "### 3.2 A Compass Between Two Worlds\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tilt the needle, it is no longer fully in ∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩.  \n",
    "We can describe its intermediate position with an **angle θ**, measured from the Z-axis.  \n",
    "The projection onto **Z+** corresponds to the **probability of being in ∣0⟩**, and the projection onto **Z−** to the **probability of being in ∣1⟩**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(0) = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{θ}{2}\\right), \\qquad\n",

    "These probabilities always sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 From Angles to Complex Amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete orientation of the compass depends not only on the angle θ, but also on the rotation around the Z-axis, which we call **phase φ**.  \n",
    "This rotation does not change the inclination, but it does change the “internal rotation” of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both parameters, we can write the quantum state as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "∣ψ⟩ = \\cos\\left(\\frac{θ}{2}\\right)∣0⟩ + e^{iφ}\\sin\\left(\\frac{θ}{2}\\right)∣1⟩\n",

    "- $β = e^{iφ}\\sin\\left(\\frac{θ}{2}\\right)$  \n",
