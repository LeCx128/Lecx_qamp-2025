    "> “When you spin a magnet suspended over a table, its direction changes gradually… until you notice that not only does it reorient, but ‘something else’ changes: the way it responds to the field, as if an invisible dimension comes into play.”\n",

    "**Guiding Questions**\n",
    "- What does it mean for a physical system to “rotate”?  \n",
    "- What information is preserved during a rotation?  \n",
    "- What kind of quantity remains unchanged even if the vector changes direction?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Objective:**  \n",
    "> Understand the analogy between a physical rotation and a phase rotation in a quantum state, building the intuition that the information of the system is not always in what is visible (the projection) but also in the internal orientation of the state.\n",

    "## 2. Explore — Hands-On Activity: Paper Strip and Phase Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials:**  \n",
    "Paper strip (10–15 cm), tape, flashlight or lamp, whiteboard or wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure:**  \n",
    "1. Attach the strip vertically to the wall or board.  \n",
    "2. Illuminate it perpendicularly with the flashlight: observe the shadow.  \n",
    "3. Rotate the strip a few degrees → the shadow changes position.  \n",
    "4. Move the flashlight (without rotating the strip) → the shadow changes even though the physical orientation remains the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "- Build a physical intuition of “phase”: the real orientation is the strip, the shadows are the *observable components*.  \n",
    "- Introduce the idea of a **second, non-visible dimension of information** (phase).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Formalize the physical experience with the strip and project it onto the mathematical plane: how a rotation or a phase affects the state without altering its norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step (Instructor Guide)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The strip as a vector**  \n",
    "   - The real orientation of the strip represents the magnetic vector or the state of a system:  \n",
    "     $ \\vec{M}(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) $  \n",
    "   - Its shadow on the X-axis is $\\cos\\theta$ and on Y is $\\sin\\theta$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Physical rotation**  \n",
    "   - Rotating the strip changes both components: the shadow “walks” from one axis to another.  \n",
    "   - This change can be represented with a rotation matrix:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     R(\\theta) =\n",
    "     \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\\n",
    "     \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Phase — The invisible dimension**  \n",
    "   - If you move the flashlight (without rotating the strip), the shadow changes even though the object does not.  \n",
    "   - Mathematically, this is equivalent to multiplying by a **complex phase** $e^{i\\phi}$:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     z' = e^{i\\phi} z, \\quad z = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta\n",
    "     $$  \n",
    "   - The phase does not change the magnitude (‖z‖ = 1), only its internal orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Didactic Interpretation**  \n",
    "   - The strip → complete state of the system.  \n",
    "   - The shadow → what is measured (projection).  \n",
    "   - The flashlight → the observer or measurement basis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conceptual Closure**  \n",
    "   - Rotating the system modifies its observable components.  \n",
    "   - Changing the phase modifies how the components are perceived without altering the physical state.  \n",
    "   - In a qubit, these operations are analogous to rotations on the Bloch sphere.\n",
