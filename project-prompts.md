### Interested in getting involved in QAMP 2025 but not able to think of a project proposal?

**Here are some categories and examples to help get you started:**

- **Research-oriented projects:** Dive into the forefront of quantum computing, exploring areas such as quantum error correction, quantum machine learning, or quantum cryptography. One of the more difficult aspects of quantum computing is encoding a problem into a quantum circuit, so QAMP provides a risk-free environment to trial such experiments. 

- **Improving the developer experience:** Design tools or libraries that simplify the use or integration of quantum algorithms and make quantum programming more accessible to a broader audience. This could also include contributing to the 'Rustification' of Qiskit (see [this article](https://medium.com/qiskit/new-weve-started-using-rust-in-qiskit-for-better-performance-a3676433ca8c) for more info) and improving the performance of some component in Qiskit, or even debugging and benchmarking. 

- **Updating applications, packages, projects, and past Qiskit coding exercises:** With the release of Qiskit version 2 in 2025, many projects built with Qiskit need updating to be compatible with Qiskit v2.x. This is an ideal project topic for beginners wanting to learn how to make their first PR. See the [Qiskit Ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) for a list of projects that are built using Qiskit and [Qiskit community](https://github.com/qiskit-community) for past QGSS and IBM Quantum Challenges.

- **Real-world problem solving:** Identify and address practical challenges in industries like finance, logistics, or healthcare using quantum computing. Mentees can contribute by researching potential applications and proposing solutions. You may consider using tools like [Qiskit Add-ons](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/addons) and set a project deliverable/goal to use one of these tools in the context of a real-world toy problem.

- **Educational content or initiatives:** Craft engaging tutorials or seminars to demystify quantum computing for beginners. This could encompass step-by-step guides, video lessons, coding challenges, and more. You may even create practice questions for courses like [John Watrous' Basics of Quantum Information course](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information) or create conceptual diagrams of processes like quantum mapping algorithms.

- **Engaging/creative projects:** Create games or simulations that illustrate quantum phenomena in an engaging and accessible manner, serving as an innovative way to introduce quantum computing to a broader audience.

If you still are out of ideas, see the [list of issues in the Qiskit repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues) and find an issue you'd like to work on. There are useful labels you may use to filter, such as the 'good first issue' label.
