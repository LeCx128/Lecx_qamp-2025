**Contents:**

>Any observations or confusions.

>Note: Our QMAP project meetings will have their records stored here.

⚙️ ***Technical:***
>This folder is the resource hub for the curriculum's core content, structure, and development standards.

>**Purpose:** To store the detailed content plans, templates, and reference materials needed for curriculum development.
