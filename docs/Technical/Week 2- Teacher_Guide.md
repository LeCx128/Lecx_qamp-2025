# Teacher Guide — Week 2
**5E:** Engage (tilt vs twist) → Explore (Composer/Qiskit) → Explain (θ, φ) → Elaborate (targets/derivation) → Evaluate (assessments).

- **Tier-1 (Composer):** Show bar chart changes with RX/RY; show no change with Phase/RZ.
- **Tier-2 (Qiskit):** Place states on the Bloch sphere using rotations; verify via statevector.
- **Tier-3 (Qiskit):** Prove phase effect: H → RZ(π) → H on |0⟩ → |−⟩ (X-basis certainty; Z stays 50/50).

**Checkpoints:** radians only; explicit RX/RY vs RZ language; screenshots or printouts attached to assessments.
