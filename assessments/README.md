# **📝 assessments Folder: Evaluation and Measurement**
This directory is dedicated to all materials used to evaluate student and developer understanding across the four curriculum tiers. The materials range from quick quizzes to in-depth coding tasks and capstone mini-projects.

📁 **Folder Structure:**
The assessment materials are categorized by format:

***quizzes:***
>Short-form assessments, including multiple-choice, true/false, and conceptual questions.	
>Crucial for Tier 1 & 2 to test foundational understanding (e.g., conceptual questions on Superposition).

***coding_tasks:***
>Focused, small-scale programming exercises designed to test specific skills.	
>Predominantly for Tier 2, 3, & 4 (e.g., implementing a simple X, Y, or Z rotation using Qiskit).

***mini_projects:***
>Larger, multi-step assignments that combine concepts from several weeks.	
>Examples include the Teleportation project (Week 4) or building a basic BB84 simulation (Week 8).

***worksheets:***
>Guided activities and structured practice problems (non-coding).
>Primarily for Tier 1 & 2 to reinforce concepts using analogies or visual exercises.
>
***🎯 Contribution Guidelines and Tier Alignment:***

**Tier Specificity:**
>Assessment materials must be clearly labeled and tailored to the specific conceptual depth required by the target tier. A Tier 1 quiz should focus on analogies, while a Tier 4 task might require a Formal Derivation or a complex Qiskit Estimator application.

**Topic Coverage:**
> Ensure comprehensive coverage of all weekly topics outlined in the Tiers Focus - Tiers Based Check List (located in docs/technical/).

**Coding Standards:**
>All coding tasks and mini-projects should utilize Qiskit and follow the latest syntax, aligning with the focus on the Qiskit Developer (Tier 3) and Advocate (Tier 4) tracks.
