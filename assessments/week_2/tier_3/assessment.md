# Tier-3 Assessment — Phase Becomes Visible
1) Derive `H RZ(π) H |0⟩ = |−⟩` (up to global phase).
2) Explain why Z-basis probabilities are unchanged by `RZ(θ)` but X-basis outcomes can flip.
3) Implement and verify with statevector + measurement.

**Rubric (10):** derivation (4), working demo (3), explanation (3).
