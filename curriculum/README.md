# **📘 curriculum Folder: Content Development**
This directory holds the core educational material, structured by the four learning tiers and supported by common **assets**.  

📁 **Folder Structure:** The content is organized into four tier-specific folders and one central folder for shared resources:

🧩 ***assets Folder Details***
>The assets folder is crucial for maintaining pedagogical consistency and providing standardized scaffolding across the curriculum.

>*Frameworks*: Documents outlining the learning objectives, pedagogical approaches, and assessment rubrics that apply across all four tiers.

>*Stories/Analogies*: Central library of high-quality, vetted analogies (like the "Un-Flip" Game for Teleportation ) and narrative elements designed to introduce complex quantum concepts conceptually.

>*Comprehension Passages*: Standardized reading material or background context that may be adapted or excerpted for use in specific tier lesson guides.

✨ ***Contribution Notes:***

>*Tier Checklists:* Always reference the master Tiers Focus - Tiers Based Check List (found in docs/technical/) to ensure the material for each tier aligns with the intended conceptual focus and complexity level.

>*Asset Use*: Materials from the assets folder should be incorporated into the tier folders (tier1 - tier4) but should not be edited within the assets folder itself without consensus.
