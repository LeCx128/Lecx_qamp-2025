# **tier_4 Folder: Qiskit Advocate Focus (Advanced Research & Application)**

This folder contains all curriculum materials designed for Tier 4, targeting Qiskit Advocates, advanced researchers, and those pursuing careers in quantum information science.

This tier is focused on mastering the theoretical foundations, implementing resource-intensive algorithms, and engaging with formal security proofs and research topics.

***ðŸŽ¯ Guiding Philosophy:***
>The focus here is on mastery, critical analysis, and the ability to contribute to advanced open-source quantum projects.

**Goal:**
>Students should not only understand how to use Qiskit but why the underlying physics and mathematics work. The level of complexity and rigor in this tier is intended to prepare users for the Qiskit Developer Certification and the high-level technical contributions expected within the Qiskit Advocate community.

**Key Topics:**
>Content includes Quantum Postulates, the No-Cloning Theorem, Stabilizer Formalism for error correction, and the rigorous BB84 Formalism & Security Proof (aligned with quantum cryptography focus).

**Source Reference:**
>All planning aligns with the "Tier 4 (Adv. Encryption) Qiskit Advocate Focus" column in the master Tiers Focus - Tiers Based Check List (found in docs/technical/).

***âœ¨ Contribution Guidelines:***

>**Certification Level Rigor:**
> All explanations, derivations, and code implementations presented at a level that meets or exceeds the requirements for the Qiskit Developer Certification and prepares users for the technical depth of advanced Qiskit projects.
>**Rigorous Proofs:**
> Content includes and explains formal mathematical proofs (e.g., the security of BB84, impossibility of the No-Cloning Theorem).

>**Advanced Qiskit:**
> Focus on using Qiskit's optimization modules and addressing challenges like Quantum Error Correction (QEC) implementation.

>**Critical Analysis:**
> Encourage critical thinking on algorithm limitations, hardware constraints, and the future viability of quantum applications in areas like Material Science and Optimization.
