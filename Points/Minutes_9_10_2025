QAMP-2025: Quantum for All
Meeting Minutes / Mentor Notes (Revised: October 14, 2025)

Date: October 9, 2025
Time: 11:00 AM
Platform: Discord
Reference: GitHub Issue #18
Mentor: Noor (Lead/Mentor)
Attendees: Noor (Lead/Mentor), Nathane, Miguel

1. Quick Greetings and Shared Vision
The meeting commenced with a brief round of greetings and updates.
The Mentor reaffirmed the project’s mission of “Democratizing Quantum Knowledge” — creating an accessible and engaging curriculum integrated into standard STEM subjects.

Guiding Principles:
Strength: Translating complex quantum concepts into practical, understandable content.

Resilience: Maintaining consistent progress through adaptive approaches.

Efficiency: Keeping a direct, solution-oriented methodology, strictly adhering to the 5-hour per week commitment.

All attendees expressed understanding and commitment to this shared vision, emphasizing the development of practical, classroom-ready resources for teachers.

2. Review of Progress on Project Tasks
The team reviewed the initial curriculum structure prepared by Nathane, confirming that it provides a solid foundation aligned with the objectives in GitHub Issue #18.

The framework’s goal is to support teachers in delivering challenging quantum concepts.

3. Curriculum Strategy and Prototype Assignments (FINALIZED SCOPE)
The scope has been formally reduced to focus on middle and high school only to ensure project completion and manage current resource constraints.

Prototype	Grade Band	Pedagogy	Integrated Subjects (Reduced)	Action Owner
Prototype 1	    6–8	Project-Based	Mathematics, Science, ICT, English	Nathane and Noor
Prototype 2   	HS+ (9+)	Advanced Project-Based	Physics, Computers (CS) ONLY	Miguel
Prototype 3   	HS+ (9+)	Advance Project-Based	English, Math	- Noor

AER Trainer Development: Miguel.

Pedagogical Challenges:

Using an integrated approach to help teachers bridge conceptual gaps across disciplines.

4. Pedagogical Framework & Standards Alignment (NON-NEGOTIABLE LIMIT)
To ensure the project's completion within the 5-hour per week time constraint, the decision on standards alignment has been finalized.

Framework	Purpose	Notes
UDL (Universal Design for Learning)	Ensures inclusivity for diverse learners	Replaces VAK; addresses accessibility and differentiation.
5E Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)	Provides familiar, effective flow for teachers	Supports cross-subject integration.

Standards Alignment:
The QAMP project will pursue agree. The final guidelines will feature a Flexible Standards Boundary, simply listing compatible standards that teachers can choose to adapt.

5. Support, Resources, and Documentation
a. Glossary Maintenance
Each prototype will maintain its own detailed glossary.

b. Core Resource
IBM Qiskit Textbook (v2) confirmed as the primary foundational material.

Curriculum learning pathway now defined as: Qiskit Textbook (v2) →K6 Algorithms → HS/AER.

c. Technical Specifications
All “Notebooks” refer to Python-based Qiskit Jupyter notebooks.
Must be compatible with Google Colab and Jupyter environments.

d. Research & Workflow Practices
All team members will record workflow steps, time spent, and progress in the shared Excel Matrix File.

6. Decisions & Agreements (FORMALLY MODIFIED)
Topic	Decision / Update	Rationale
Grade Bands	6−8,HS+ (Final Scope)	Limits scope to achievable level; K2−K5 removed due since the mentee offered this band has withdrawn for personal commitments.
Frameworks	UDL + 5E with Flexible Standards Boundary	Eliminates workload.
Prototype 2 (Miguel)	Content creation limited to Physics and Computer Science only.	Reduces workload to fit the 5-hour per week commitment.
Learning Pathway	Qiskit Textbook (v2) →K6 Algorithms → HS/AER	Streamlines the progression.

7. Action Items
Task	Owner	Deadline	Status
Develop and share initial rough sketches/frameworks for assigned curriculum prototypes	
All Team Members	Oct 14, 2025	Delayed / Scope Re-evaluation Pending
Proceed with content creation based on REDUCED SCOPE limits.	All Team Members	ASAP	NEW
P2 (Miguel): Complete AER Trainer workbook/guidelines limited to CS/Physics.	Miguel	
Review and align all prototypes with Bloom’s Taxonomy + UDL + 5E	Noor	D	

8. Reflection (Mentor’s Note)
The mentor's focus remains on ensuring pedagogical quality, Bloom’s alignment, and cognitive accessibility at every grade level. The final scope reduction is a mandatory step to ensure the project is delivered with high quality and respects the time constraints of the team. It is further mandated that all work must strictly adhere to the 5-hour per week commitment. The QAMP project is transitioning smoothly from conceptual design to curriculum implementation.

9. Next Steps
Preparatory Check-In: October 14, 2025 (To be conducted privately to confirm adherence to the new scope.)

QMAP 2025 Official Launch: October 15, 2025.
