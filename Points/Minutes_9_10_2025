## 1. Quick Greetings and Shared Vision
The meeting commenced with a brief round of greetings and updates.  
The Mentor reaffirmed the project’s mission of **“Democratizing Quantum Knowledge”** — creating an accessible and engaging curriculum integrated into standard STEM subjects.  

### Guiding Principles:
- **Strength:** Translating complex quantum concepts into practical, understandable content.  
- **Resilience:** Maintaining consistent progress through adaptive approaches.  
- **Efficiency:** Keeping a direct, solution-oriented methodology.

All mentees expressed understanding and commitment to this shared vision, emphasizing the development of **practical, classroom-ready resources** for teachers.

## 2. Review of Progress on Project Tasks
- The team reviewed the initial curriculum structure prepared by **Nathane**, confirming that it provides a **solid foundation** aligned with the objectives in *GitHub Issue #18*.  
- The framework’s goal is to **support teachers** in delivering challenging quantum concepts through:
  - Sample Worksheets  
  - Jupyter Notebooks  
  - Structured Lesson Plans  
  - Assessment Tools  

This phase validated that the curriculum remains both technically grounded and pedagogically accessible.

## 3. Curriculum Strategy and Prototype Assignments
### Development Plan by Grade Bands (Revised)
| Prototype | Grade Band | Pedagogy | Integrated Subjects | Action Owner |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Prototype 1** | K–2 | Story & Role-Play (Activity-Based Learning) | Science, English, Math | Noor |
| **Prototype 2** | 3–5 | Story & Project-Based | Science, Math, Computers, English | Nathane |
| **Prototype 3** | 6–8 | Project-Based | Mathematics, Science, ICT, English | Nathane |
| **Prototype 4** | HS+ | Advanced Project-Based | Physics, Chemistry, Math, Computers, English | Miguel |

*AER Trainer Development:* Pending final assignment.  

### Pedagogical Challenges:
- Introducing **quantum states and waves** at appropriate grade levels.  
- Differentiating between **classical and quantum science** for younger learners.  
- Using an **integrated approach** to help teachers bridge conceptual gaps across disciplines.

### Instructional Workflow & Methodology:
- Lessons will follow a **cross-disciplinary** structure.  
- Each lesson may start with a **subject anchor** (e.g., an English comprehension passage introducing a quantum idea).  
- The content will expand naturally to include Math, Science, and ICT connections.

**Example:**  
A passage titled *“The Nature of Light”* links to:  
- Mathematics → Probability concepts  
- Science → Particle-wave duality  
- ICT → Qiskit simulation exercises

## 4. Pedagogical Framework & Standards Alignment
| Framework | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **UDL (Universal Design for Learning)** | Ensures inclusivity for diverse learners | Replaces VAK to address accessibility and differentiation. |
| **5E Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)** | Provides familiar, effective flow for teachers | Supports cross-subject integration and Bloom’s alignment. |
| **Bloom’s Taxonomy** | Cognitive skill development | Mentor to ensure all prototypes include multi-level learning outcomes. |
| **CSTA / NGSS / CCSS** | Education standard references | Included for global consistency and easier alignment for school administrators. |

**Global Grade Equivalence:**  
*Primaria (Elementary) → Secundaria (Middle) → Bachiller Superior (High School / AER)* — contributed by Miguel.

## 5. Support, Resources, and Documentation
The team agreed on a professional documentation system to ensure reproducibility and academic quality.

### a. Glossary Maintenance
- Each prototype must maintain its own **detailed glossary**, defining:  
  - All **key terms** (e.g., qubit, entanglement)  
  - All **symbols and notation** used  
  - All **Qiskit commands** and functions (e.g., `import`, `backend`, `sampler`)  
- Purpose: To ensure clarity for teachers, future developers, and curriculum reviewers.

### b. Core Resource
- **IBM Qiskit Textbook (v2)** confirmed as the **primary foundational material**.  
- Curriculum learning pathway now defined as:  
  **Qiskit Textbook (v2) → K–8 Algorithms → HS/AER.**

### c. Technical Specifications
- All “Notebooks” refer to **Python-based Qiskit Jupyter notebooks**.  
- Must be compatible with **Google Colab** and **Jupyter environments**.  
- Designed for lightweight execution even on school-level devices.

### d. Research & Workflow Practices
- All team members will record:  
  - Workflow steps  
  - Time spent  
  - Task completion progress  
  in the shared **Excel Matrix File** (project tracker).  
- Members will also maintain **personal checklists** for granular tracking and research documentation.
